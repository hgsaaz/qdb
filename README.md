## Reflection

  - Used typescrit as it provides more type binding and increase the project excellence and make error/bugs probability less.
  - Used React Boilerplate Typescript to setup project.
  - Statemanagemnt by React/Redux and used saga for fetching data as middleware
  - Used Ant Deign as UI component best suited with Typescript.
  - I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
  - Used craco-config instead of using react-scripts env files.
